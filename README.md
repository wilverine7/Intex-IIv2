# Intex-IIv2
A website that connects to a postgres database storing mummy data from BYU's archeology department. This was built as a end of semester school project of the course of one week. 
There is authentication and user roles that allow different privalages from viewing to editing and deleting data. Additionally there is a basic predictive analaytic model 
that predicts mummy head direction based on burial depth and other factors. We used AWS to host.
